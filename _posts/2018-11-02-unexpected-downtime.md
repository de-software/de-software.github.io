Hey there everyone! We at DE Software want to apologize for some upcoming unexpected downtime across a few of our services. This downtime will be affecting all of our Chat Bots and Servers for an unknown amount of time. We are actively working on a solution and will notify our clients and users as soon as possible. Follow us on our twitters, either the [DE Software twitter](https://twitter.com/WeAreDESoftware) or my [personal twitter](https://twitter.com/DomElement0001), or check on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/RPRPeCe) for updates on this situation!

Thanks everyone for understanding! We hope you have wonderful days.
