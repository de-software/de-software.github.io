Hello, everyone. My name is DocRider, and I am a new member of DE Software. I will be heading a new feature coming soon. I am also a streamer and you can find my streams [here](https://twitch.tv/doc_rider)!

However, that is not the main point of this post. What is is the fact that the new website and products pages has been completed. Now you can go and find the best package for what you want. You can find prices for Discord bots [here](https://de-software.github.io/bot-pricing.html), for websites [here](https://de-software.github.io/web-pricing.html), and for software [here](https://de-software.github.io/app-pricing.html).

Thanks for the continued support and hopefully we be able to help with your software needs.
